# Consolidation completion audit

Beads `gohawk-dho.23` tracks this audit against the original objective:
clean architecture, no duplicated proof mechanics, and all remaining easy
false positives addressed. Completion is still unproven. The source base for
this review is `3524977`, followed by the scalar/type/loop/evidence
consolidation tracked in `gohawk-dho.24`.

## Requirements and evidence

| Requirement | Current evidence | Status and remaining verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shared responsibilities and downward dependencies | The architecture guide names the SSA, heap, lifecycle, resource and summary layers. Repository-wide architecture tests enforce imports, analyzer layout, fact ownership, summary access, traversal and reporting boundaries. | Structural conformance has passing canonical receipts. It does not prove every proof policy is cohesive; semantic review remains open. |
| No duplicated proof mechanics | The value-walk and storage/summary reviews document concrete merges and distinct policies. The broader normalized-body scan below found five additional mechanical duplicate groups, now consolidated. | The identified groups are addressed. Partial blocks and equivalent logic written differently remain outside that scan; no repository-wide absence claim is made. |
| One authoritative decision for each check | Reviewed lifecycle analyzers classify once and ask a shared flow query. The remaining normalized matches in classifier caches and state keys contain different domain state, rather than second acceptance rules. | Positive evidence for reviewed paths; a complete decision-owner inventory across checks is still needed. |
| Remaining easy FPs fixed | Frozen batches 62/63 supplied 55 production FP locations. The queue refresh, successful 22-site replay and four subsequent corrections leave 18 unresolved production sites. The ten-family assessment states the missing evidence for each. Rune callback wait is separately corrected; fresh-lock publication remains open. | No target-resolution-only correction has been demonstrated. The remaining families need policy, identity, state or protocol evidence. Further current-source review must distinguish a newly available bounded fix from a genuinely larger model. |
| Precision preserved by consolidation | Parent/current boundary comparisons, accepted and diagnostic fixtures, ordinary tests and local dogfood scans accompany focused changes. Existing facts retain must/may polarity, exact binding, observation time and bounded unknown outcomes. | Passing receipts prove their stated scopes. They do not certify every historical finding against the latest source. Use affected pinned cases when behavior changes; do not rewrite frozen labels or credit unscannable cases. |
| Tight development cycle | Focused tests precede stable `make verify` gates. The local gate runs ordinary tests, formatting, vet, lint, dead-code and local dogfood; it does not invoke precision-regression. | Maintained. No full precision replay or local race run is part of these iterations. |
| Work tracked and own changes published | Beads children record corrections, reviews and unresolved questions. Implementation commits contain exact task paths; unrelated staged deletion and working-tree artifacts remain separate. | Verify commit, upstream synchronization and child closure after each implementation. The epic and this completion audit remain active. |

## Broader duplicate-candidate scan

A local Go AST/token scanner examined 266 production Go files and 1,992
function bodies under `internal/` at the source base. It excludes tests,
generated source, fixture/testdata/vendor trees and dot/underscore trees,
matching the repository's source-inventory exclusions. It compares complete
function bodies of at least 35 tokens after normalizing identifier names;
string/numeric literals, operators and keywords remain distinct. Predeclared
identifiers such as true, false and nil are normalized too. It is not
type-aware and supplies candidates, not proof of equivalent semantics.

All ten resulting groups were inspected in source. The local artifacts are
`.build/goal-duplicate-functions.go` and
`.build/goal-duplicate-functions.json`; these are review aids, not a new gate.

| Candidate group | Reviewed disposition |
| --- | --- |
| `storageInteger` / `StorageInteger` | Heap slice bounds now use `ssaflow.StorageInteger`; omitted-bound defaults and exact integer conversion remain unchanged. |
| `addressedStruct` / `structBehind` | `syntax.PointerStruct` owns the one-pointer underlying-struct shape. The other copies of this shape check use it too, retaining domain identity and ownership checks. Named pointers and aliases remain supported; value structs and nested pointers remain outside this shape. |
| `panics` / `endsInPanic` | `ssaflow.BlockEndsInPanic` owns the last-instruction check. Concurrency inference retains its separate recovery and return-witness rules; an explicit panic does not prove whole-function termination. |
| `dominatesLatches` / `dominatesBackEdges` | `NaturalLoop.DominatesBackEdges` owns the predecessor dominance query. Its guarantee excludes break/exit paths; it is not a claim that the block runs on every possible loop path. |
| `lockEvidence` / `Evidence` | Lock acquisition and helper-route spans now use `check.Evidence`; source ranges and labels retain the existing behavior. |
| Resource flow key / obligation flow key | Each key includes its own obligation state and path guards. Both use the shared work-list driver; replacing domain keys with one generic obligation would lose resource state. |
| Spawn/resource classifier cache adapters | Both memoize their authoritative classifier and trace its result. Action and reason types, evidence families and reporting rules differ; there is no second classifier decision in these adapters. |
| Field/global/enclosing-scope stores | Destination-specific leaf queries. Field/global stores ask possible alias; enclosing-scope stores ask derivation. Their provenance mechanics are already shared, and the distinct queries must not silently acquire one another's policy. |
| Spawn/resource budget adapters | Each lazily owns a candidate pool, chooses its domain limit and observer, and delegates charging to `SearchBudget.Within`. The pool mechanics are shared; domain limits and candidate ownership remain local. |
| Lock handoff / returned owner | Lock handoff compares arguments with alias or derivation; returned ownership compares results with alias or aggregate containment under an ownership search. Identifier normalization hides that material difference. |

The post-change scan sees 1,987 bodies in the same 266 files and retains the
five justified domain-adapter groups above. This proves only the disposition
of this candidate set. It does not find partial duplication, differently
structured equivalent predicates, small bodies, or code outside `internal/`.

## Final-decision mismatch found during catalog review

At `015bc08`, `processownership.reportStartedCommand` emitted its final trace
before its existing `commandUnusedAfterStart` suppression. The browser-launch
fixture was correctly silent but traced `unowned-return` as rejected. A focused
trace regression reproduced this mismatch on the parent.

Beads `gohawk-dho.25` moves that final suppression into `decideProcessReturn`.
Its structured state and reason are consumed by reporting and tracing: an
uncovered unused command is unknown, a reportable unowned return is proven,
and a fully covered flow retains its accepted/ambiguous outcome. The command
use query still runs only after an uncovered return is found, preserving the
existing query order and diagnostic boundary. Earlier pre-Start suppression
paths remain separate; this does not claim complete tracing coverage.

The focused analyzer tests cover exactly one unknown browser-launch decision
and retain the accepted/rejected/opaque-handoff assertions. Parent/current
fixture JSON and the traced invocation are recorded under
`.build/goal-process-decision-*`; they compare diagnostic output independently
of the corrected trace. Both `-enable-all -json` fixture invocations exit 3
with empty stderr and identical nonempty diagnostic JSON (31,707 bytes).
The final traced receipt is `.build/goal-process-decision-all.trace.jsonl`;
the earlier invocations without all checks produced empty output and are not
used as equivalence evidence. Canonical `make verify` passes, including the
ordinary suite (54 seconds), formatting, vet, lint, dead-code and local
dogfood (`.build/goal-process-decision-verify.log`). No full precision corpus
or local race run was performed. No audited FP removal is credited.

This finding confirms why a complete decision-owner review is still required
even after duplicate-body consolidation.

## Next verification

The remaining architecture audit must trace decision ownership across the
catalog and inspect partial duplication in resource-state and obligation
classification, beyond complete-body matches. It must also compare the
unresolved precision families with current helpers, rather than assuming
the earlier assessment permanently excludes an easy correction.

The [value-walk review](value-walk-review.md),
[storage/summary review](storage-summary-review.md), and
[remaining FP assessment](../../benchmarks/precision/audits/remaining-fp-assessment-2026-10-01.md)
remain scoped supporting evidence. Passing their checks is not a substitute
for the requirement-by-requirement completion audit.
