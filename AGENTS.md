# gohawk development guidance

Value high precision over high recall. Avoiding false alerts is more important
than detecting every possible violation: users must be able to trust that a
gohawk diagnostic is actionable.

- Report only when the analyzer has strong evidence that the policy is
  violated on a feasible path. When ownership or lifecycle behavior is
  uncertain, prefer no diagnostic.
- Model common cleanup, ownership-transfer, registration, and lifecycle
  patterns before expanding an analyzer's coverage.
- Do not use suppression comments as a substitute for fixing a recurring
  false-positive pattern.
- Give every analyzer change focused regression fixtures for both the
  diagnostic and accepted forms. Minimize patterns found through dogfooding
  rather than copying external repositories into the test suite.
- Dogfood changes on representative real-world repositories and investigate
  newly introduced findings before enabling broader coverage.
- Avoid project-name or function-name exemptions unless they represent a
  documented, general API contract.

## Analyzer rationale comments

Add comments at non-obvious precision boundaries: ownership transfers,
feasible-path assumptions, conservative bailouts, and distinctions between
default and opt-in diagnostics. Explain why the analyzer accepts or rejects a
pattern and what evidence makes that decision safe; do not merely restate the
code.

When dogfooding reveals a representative real-world pattern, include a
commit-pinned source link in the nearby rationale comment. Keep the minimized
fixture as the executable regression test. Prefer one durable comment at the
decision point over repeating the explanation throughout helper functions.

Preserve these comments when refactoring. If behavior or its supporting
evidence changes, update the rationale, link, and regression fixture together.

The `analysisutil` package is intentionally unsupported and undocumented for
external consumers. It is exposed only for Veritas's current integration.

## Documentation website

Use `pnpm dev:review` from `site/` when testing the documentation website. It
starts the Astro development server together with the Agentation services, so
annotations can be submitted to an agent during review.
