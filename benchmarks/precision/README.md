# Precision regression cohorts

These cohorts preserve human review from repeatable dogfood runs.
Each repository is pinned to an exact revision. The gate fails if a reviewed
false positive returns or a reviewed true positive disappears.

Run both cohorts with `make precision-regression`, or replay one cohort while
reusing retained checkouts:

```sh
scripts/precision-regression.py benchmarks/precision/round-3 \
  --checkout-root /path/to/checkouts
```

Checkout directories use the `owner__repository` naming convention. The
harness analyzes the three shallowest Go modules, matching the original pilot.
New diagnostics are intentionally reported by normal dogfooding review rather
than guessed to be regressions: only a human can label a new finding.

Round 4 contains the 20 false positives fixed from a 15-repository traced
audit plus all 23 reviewed true positives. The full audit, including the
remaining labeled noise families, lives in the companion lead-generation
study rather than being encoded as accepted benchmark behavior.
