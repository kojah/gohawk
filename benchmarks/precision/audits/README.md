# 500-repository precision audit

`500-repository.tsv` is the append-only selection ledger for the 50-batch
`-enable-all` audit. Repository revisions and analyzed modules are pinned so a
finding can be reproduced after the temporary checkout is gone. `reviewed`
means the batch's diagnostics were grouped and inspected for generalizable,
high-confidence false positives; it does not mean every policy finding was
adopted by the external project.

## Batch 1

Ten repositories and eleven modules were scanned. Three recurring evidence
gaps were fixed:

- an immediately invoked closure that registers a nested cleanup defer;
- a launched process waiter that registers `Wait` through a nested defer; and
- direct reaping through `cmd.Process.Wait`.

The fixes remove findings in uzomuzo, feint, and mache. Nearby unclosed HTTP
responses, transactions without rollback, and successful process starts with
no complete reap path remained reportable and are pinned in precision round 5.
Cloudemu produced no findings. Uzomuzo's CGO-only tree-sitter package did not
load under the audit's `CGO_ENABLED=0` environment; its other packages were
still analyzed.
